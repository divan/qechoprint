# qechoprint 

QEchoPrint is a Qt-based application for music identification based on awesome [open-source EchoPrint project](http://echoprint.me/) by EchoNest. It designed for Maemo/Meego platforms, but also runs on Linux/Mac/Win desktops and should work on Symbian devices. Contributions are welcome.

## Status

The app is in alpha stage, thus not released to Maemo/Meego repositories. I will be added as soon as it be considered ready.

## Requirements

* [echoprint-codegen](http://github.com/echonest/echoprint-codegen) library (available in Maemo repositories)
